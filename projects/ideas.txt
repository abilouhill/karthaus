Here are two project ideas.  Which we do is up to you.

1.  FIXME:  NEW IDEA NEEDED


2.  HOW FAST DOES A REGIONAL MODEL DIVERGE FROM A SURROUNDING WHOLE ICE SHEET MODEL?

In the lectures we already have a (minimal!) isothermal SIA model for the whole Antarctic ice sheet.  The achievable resolution of such a model is limited by the stability properties of the explicit scheme, the (floating point) computational time, and the memory access time.  If the full three-dimensional temperature and velocity fields are evaluated or stored, the achievable resolution can be limited by the raw amount of memory in use.  For reasons like these, researchers often build regional models with higher resolution but having smaller spatial extent.  Also, data may be available for the region that is not available for the whole ice sheet; perhaps an individual outlet glacier or ice stream/shelf has been more densely observed.  Because regional models do not cover the whole ice sheet, they need boundary conditions connecting them to the rest of the ice sheet.  By setting up an idealized ice cap on a non-flat bed, we compare the volume and flow speed within a region R of a whole ice sheet model to the same properties for a model of R alone.  That is, there are two models that cover R, one being the whole ice sheet model and the other just covering R, but where the boundary conditions for the second regional model are provided initially and then held fixed in time.  In the simplest comparison we can keep the grid resolution the same in both models, so that the only difference is in the boundary conditions on the regional model.  Students will choose the boundary conditions, and the tools to cut out and simulate the region, based on Bueler's codes for the whole ice sheet.
