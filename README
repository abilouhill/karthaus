#  Copyright 2009--2010  Ed Bueler

These files are the electronic form of Bueler's lectures at the 2010 Karthaus
Summer School on Glaciology.  An earlier version was used in 2009.

The lectures (lecture.pdf, along with the reference list in refs.pdf) are
supposed to be a self-contained course.  Self-contained, that is, if you don't
want to do exercises (exers.pdf) or actually run and modify codes.

Working with actual codes is recommended!  See mfiles/ for the Matlab/Octave 
programs.  The lectures are the major documentation of these programs.  Note
that there are also help comments (= leading comments) in the Matlab/Octave
programs.  These help comments contain examples indicating how to run the
programs.

The directory petsc/ contains a C code using the PETSc library to solve the
same SSA problem as solved by some of the Matlab/Octave programs.  Wise students
would only look in petsc/ after becoming reasonably familiar with the
Matlab/Octave versions.
