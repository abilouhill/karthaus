Bueler's karthaus materials
========

Copyright 2009--2012  Ed Bueler

These are notes and codes for my numerical lectures at the Karthaus (Italy)
Summer School on Ice Sheets and Glaciers.  This is the 2012 version; I have
lectured there in 2009 and 2010 also.

The Karthaus website is at

http://www.projects.science.uu.nl/iceclimate/karthaus/

The notes (`notes.pdf`) are suitable for printing and off-line study.
The slides for the lectures (`slides.pdf`) are also here.

The notes plus their exercises plus the Matlab codes form a self-contained
course.  You are encouraged to  actually run and modify the codes.  See
subdirectory `mfiles/`.  The notes and slides are the major documentation
of these programs, but they also have help files (i.e. leading comments).

The directory `petsc/` contains a C code using the [PETSc]()
library to solve the same SSA problem as in the Matlab codes.
Please look in `petsc/` only after becoming reasonably familiar
with the Matlab versions.
