Bueler's karthaus materials
========

Copyright 2009--2014  Ed Bueler

These are notes and codes for my numerical lectures at the Karthaus (Italy)
Summer School on Ice Sheets and Glaciers.  The Karthaus website is at

http://www.projects.science.uu.nl/iceclimate/karthaus/

The notes (`notes/notes-sept2014.pdf`) are suitable for printing and off-line
study.  The slides for the lectures (`slides-sept2014.pdf`) are also here.

The notes plus their exercises plus the Matlab codes form a self-contained
course.  The codes are in subdirectory `mfiles/`.  The notes and slides are
the major documentation of these programs, but they also have help files
(i.e. leading comments).  You are encouraged to actually run and modify the
codes!

The directory `petsc/` contains a C code using the [PETSc](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/)
library to solve the same SSA problem as in the Matlab codes.
Please look in `petsc/` only after becoming reasonably familiar
with the Matlab versions.

This is the 2014 version.  See `BUILD.md` for using LaTeX to recompile the
notes and slides.  If needed, materials from years 2009, 2010, 2012 can be
recovered from this repo's history.
