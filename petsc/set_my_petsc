# Use this file in bash shell to set your PETSc directory and architecture.

# Note that PETSc versions earlier than 3.1 may not work.

export PETSC_DIR=~/petsc-3.1/
export PETSC_ARCH=mpich-gcc-dbg   # for performance measurements, do something like
                                  #   "make PETSC_ARCH=mpich-gcc-opt"
                                  # to switch to the optimized PETSc
