The SSA code  ssaflowline.c  solves the same problem solved by the Matlab/Octave
codes
   testshelf.m,  ssaflowline.m,  flowline.m
in directory mfiles/.

See the PDF lecture slides for a description of the problem and of the Picard iteration solution implemented in the Matlab/Octave codes.  See notes/jacobiannotes.pdf for more.

To build and run in this directory:
  0)  needs PETSc version 3.2
  1)  make sure PETSC_DIR and PETSC_ARCH are set correctly
  2)  build:
        $ make
  3)  run with defaults:
        $ ./ssaflowline
  4)  get help and suggestions on other options combinations:
        $ ./ssaflowline -help |less

Thanks to Jed Brown for help developing this example.
