THOUGHTS after the lectures:

1.  Need to be well-aligned to 3 discrete hours.

3.  Might actually help to say "this is V & V and what it means ... note I am obsessed with verification at the tool-building stage"

4.  Add emphasis on the "H\ne h means it isn't really a diffusion ... note we end up differentiating the bed" ... but then note Schoof (2003) for diffusive effect of bed topography and Schoof (2007) for outer problem associated to rapid-sliding SSA

6.  Talk in general terms about the numerical treatment of the mass continuity equation, e.g. for SSA too.

7.  When showing free boundary problems, go from least controversial to most:  CTS then Schoof's plastic till streams then SIA steady.

8.  Compare SIA, esp Halfar soln, to honey on a slide

9.  Show Barnes figure from Mahaffy
