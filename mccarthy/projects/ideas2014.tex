\section*{PROJECT 5: Models for hydrology and sliding on the Kennicott glacier}

\begin{quote}
\noindent ADVISOR: Ed Bueler

\medskip
\noindent DESCRIPTION: We will follow \cite{Bartholomausetal2011} in building a ``lumped'' numerical model of the hydrology and sliding of the Kennicott glacier during summer conditions, especially considering the sliding generated by the annual flood from the drainage of Hidden Creek Lake.  Their model involves ordinary differential equations and is well-constrained by data.  Then we'll look at either inverting the model for subglacial parameters or extending the model to a flowline where different parts of the glacier can respond at different rates.

\medskip
\noindent SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS: Matlab or Octave

\medskip
\noindent REQUIRED STUDENT BACKGROUND: Minimal exposure to differential equations and use of Matlab or similar.
\end{quote}

\subsection*{Details}  I'll refer to  \cite{Bartholomausetal2011} as ``Barth.''  Read it.  Note that my J.~Glaciol.~``Correspondence'' \citep{Bueler2014correspondence} is an attempt to clarify Barth for the modern reader!

The basic mass conservation idea is unstated (but implicit) in Barth:
\begin{equation}
\frac{dS}{dt} = Q_{in} - Q_{out}. \label{eq:massconserve}
\end{equation}
Also unstated in Barth, but implicit, is the basic decomposition $S = S_{en} + S_{sub}$ to give the total storage in terms of the englacial and subglacial parts.  The great advantage of the Barth model, which works for the Kennicott glacier, is that the input and output fluxes $Q_{in},Q_{out}$ are \emph{measured time series}.

Barth basically uses total storage $S$ and cavity cross-sectional area $A_c$ as the evolving variables.  Barth gives equation (4) for $A_c$.  To match other subglacial hydrology literature \citep[for example]{Hewitt2011}, however, it might help to think in terms of subglacial water pressure $P$ and the cavity size $A_c$ as the primary variables, as below.  Note that $A_c$ is equivalent to the average bed separation.  Because the subglacial cavities are full in this model, however, $A_c$ is also equivalent to the thickness of the subglacial water layer.

Observe $P = \rho_w g z_w$ is implicit in equation (2) in Barth; this is the ``piezometer'' idea.  From equation (1) in Barth this means $P = ((\rho_w g)/(LW\phi)) S_{en}$.  Also $S_{sub} = (fLW/h) A_c$ follows from reading the text on the bedrock bumps.  Thus, given the pair $A_c,P$ we can recover the pair $S_{en},S_{sub}$, and vice-versa.

I suggest actually using these equations from my Correspondence \citep{Bueler2014correspondence}:
\begin{equation}
\frac{dA_c}{dt} = u_b h + Z - C_c A_c (P_o-P)^n,  \label{eq:cavityevolution}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\frac{dP}{dt} = \frac{\rho_w g}{L W \phi} \left(Q_{in}(t) - Q_{out}(t) - \frac{f L }{h} \frac{d A_c}{dt}\right), \label{eq:pressureevolution}
\end{equation}
because this pair of evolution equations is closer to the modern subglacial paradigm laid out by \cite{Hewitt2011} (e.g.~see his equation (10)).  This ODE system can be treated as
\begin{equation}
M \frac{d\bv}{dt} = G(t,\bv) \label{eq:system}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{v}$ is the vector of two unknowns $A_c,P$, and $M$ is a fixed lower triangular matrix, and $G$ is the formula from the right sides of equations \eqref{eq:cavityevolution} and \eqref{eq:pressureevolution}.  Note melt $Z$ in \eqref{eq:cavityevolution} is determined by (4) in Barth from geometric and/or known constants and $Q_{out}$; i.e.~$Z=\alpha Q_{out}$ where $\alpha$ is constant.

To determine sliding, note equation (1) in Barth gives $z_w$ from $S_{en}$, thus $P$, and then equation (2) from Barth gives the effective pressure $N$.  Then equation (3) in Barth gives sliding velocity $u_b$.  The combination gives this formula for sliding in terms of $P$:
\begin{equation}
u_b = \frac{C \tau_b^n}{(P_o - P)^\gamma} \label{eq:sliding}
\end{equation}
where $P_o=\rho_i g H$ is the ice overburden pressure.  This equation can be used by post-processing on the solution to the ODE system.

Use ODE solver to solve system \eqref{eq:system} above.  Values of $\phi,g,\rho_w,h,w_c,\lambda_x,\lambda_y,f,\gamma,k=C\tau_b^n$ are all given on page 999 in Barth.

Do the synthetic case from Figure 6 in Barth first.  Then use data from Tim in file \texttt{Bartholomaus2011_Fig7.txt} and get Figure 7 in Barth.  View the data, and see by example how to read it, by running \texttt{showbarthdata.m} in Octave or Matlab.

Comment:  Instead of the above strategy, one could instead use ODE system \eqref{eq:massconserve} and \eqref{eq:cavityevolution} with $P$ in \eqref{eq:cavityevolution} written as $P= c_1 S_{en} = c_1 (S - S_{sub}) = c_1 (S - c_2 A_c)$; this is closer to what Barth did I think \dots

The following extensions are probably not something we will get to, but they might help conceptually to state:\begin{itemize}

\item[Extension 1.\quad] \emph{Inversion for subglacial parameters}.  From formula (4) in Barth for the evolution of $A_c$, it makes sense, given all that is \emph{unknown} subglacially, to write equation \eqref{eq:cavityevolution} as
\begin{equation}
\frac{dA_c}{dt} = \beta u_b + \alpha Q_{out} - C_c A_c (P_o-P)^n. \label{eq:cavityevolutionforinversion}
\end{equation}
Then one could do inversion for $\alpha,\beta,C_c$ to fit data from Figure 8.  (For now this would require hand-digitizing Figure 8a.)  Roughly $\alpha$ is a scale for melting as a cavity-opening process, $\beta$ is a scale for mechanical cavity-opening processes, and $C_c$ is a scale for all cavity-closure processes.

\item[Extension 2.\quad] \emph{Distributed version of the model}.  From Correspondence \citep{Bueler2014correspondence} we have a PDE for a distributed flowline version:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\phi W}{\rho_w g} \frac{\partial P}{\partial t} = - \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{f}{h} \left[u_b h + Z - C_c A_c (P_o-P)^n\right]. \label{eq:barth:distpressure}
\end{equation}
Using this requires speculation on Darcy flux, a formula for $Q$ in terms of $A_c$ and other variables; see also \cite{BuelervanPeltDRAFT} on this topic.

\end{itemize}

\section*{Project 6: From ice shelves in the lab to good numerical models}

\begin{quote}
\noindent ADVISOR: Ed Bueler

\medskip
\noindent DESCRIPTION:  Ice shelves and ice streams meet at grounding lines.  One of the keys to effective modelling of the evolving Antarctic ice sheet is capturing the way grounding lines move.  New laboratory models using glycerine and salt water give well-measured moving grounding lines and ice shelves.  For a strong-lateral-confinement-case laboratory model \citep{Pegleretal2013} we will build simple numerical schemes for the shallow equations which describe the dynamics.  Bypassing the speculative literature of numerical grounding line modelling, we'll have the chance to be actually wrong: we will know the misfit between the numerical model and the observations.
