The data in `Bartholomaus2011_Fig7.txt` are from an email from Tim Bartholomaus
on 9 July 2014:

> I'm attaching a tab-delimited text file.  Let me know if you have any trouble writing a framework to read this.  I'm just assuming that platform-independent tab-text is the easiest for you.  Other formats are trivial too.
>
> First column is time (day of year 2006)
>
> Second is Q_in (m^3/s)
>
> Third is Q_out (m^3/s)
>
> Fourth is U_sliding (m/d)
>
> As stated (maybe only in Fig. 10?), phi = 7e-3, gamma = 0.22 and CTaub^b = 3e-4 for the Us attached here (from Fig 7 and 8).
>
> Please let me know if you need anything further or have other questions that come up.

> Cheers,
