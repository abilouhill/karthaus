These are notes for my numerical lectures at the Karthaus (Italy)
Summer School on Ice Sheets and Glaciers.  The Karthaus school page website is

building the LaTeX notes
------------------------

The lectures are in the main `karthaus/` directory.  Build those
first.  Then create a link to `pism/doc/ice-bib.bib` in the current
(i.e. `karthaus/notes/`) subdirectory.  Then do `make` in the current
subdirectory.
