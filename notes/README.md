These are notes for my numerical lectures at the Karthaus (Italy)
Summer School on Ice Sheets and Glaciers.  They are also a draft of
my chapter in the "Karthaus book".

The Karthaus school page website is at

  http://www.projects.science.uu.nl/iceclimate/karthaus/

The lectures and codes are in the main `karthaus/` directory.  Build those
first.  Then create a link to `pism/doc/ice_bib.bib` in the current
`karthaus/notes/` subdirectory.  Then do `make` in this subdirectory.
