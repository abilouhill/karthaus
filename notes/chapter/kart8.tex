comments 


  * My highest priority is to stick to the slogans I have in my Karthaus slides,
    first "focus on approximating ice flow" (i.e. my limited scope) and
    second "example numerical codes actually work".
    
  * Thus a high priority is the inclusion of about four 40 line (or so) Matlab
    codes right into the text.  And about 12 codes which can be grabbed from
    an online source.  Is this o.k.?  If not I really need to start over.
    It is hard to "capture" the spirit of my lectures without saying "here is
    a running code that actually does something and has no mysteries now".
  
  * My goal is 20--25 pages; my Karthaus lectures in 2009 and 2010 were three
    hours but brevity is a better goal.

  * I am assuming that this chapter is only quasi-independent of the rest,
    in the sense that I can be very brief in stating SIA and SSA models, and 
    can refer to conservation of mass and energy material elsewhere.

  * The headings and subheadings were chosen with some care but I hope they
    will be revisable.  I'm afraid the structure of my material depends in
    part on the content of chapters 1 (=flow of ice), 2 (=thermal structure),
    and 10 (=analytical models) at least.

  * Can I suggest putting analytical models before numerical methods (e.g.
    swap current 8 and 10)?  I don't plan on creating a strong dependence
    but I am happy for readers to see the "right" order.
